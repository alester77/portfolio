# portfolio
## My name is Alexa Lester and this is my professional portfolio. I made this to create a visual representation of my work and progress through my coding bootcamp. It showcases the sites that I have worked on. I learned a lot about formatting html and css throughout this portfolio project and it helped solidify my skills that I've learned in class and on my own time.  

## Credits
### I want to thank my teacher and TA's through this project as well as my tutor Corey Yates. She helped explain things in a way that saved me a lot of time in research and implementing what I learned.
